# Uber & Lyft Price Prediction - Linear Regression Model

*Introduction*

Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft have made getting around cities easier. But figuring out how much a ride will cost can be confusing. This project aims to help by creating a system that predicts ride prices more accurately.

*Objective*

Our goal is to make ride prices clearer for both passengers and drivers. We're using data and math to build a tool that guesses how much a ride will cost based on things like distance and type of ride. By doing this, we hope to make ride-hailing easier and fairer for everyone involved.

*Dataset*

[Uber & Lyft Activities in Boston, MA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma) is very beginner-friendly dataset that is suitable to use for Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predictors.

*Method*

1. **Data Loading**: We start by retrieving the necessary data from our chosen source.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: During this phase, we explore the dataset to understand its characteristics and uncover insights. Through visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analyses, we gain valuable insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: This stage involves data preprocessing to create meaningful features for modeling. Techniques such as scaling of numerical features and encoding of categorical variables are employed here.

4. **Modeling**: We employ Linear Regression algorithm to develop a predictive pricing model for ride-hailing services. Model performance is then evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and MAPE to ensure robustness and generalizability.

5. **Conclusion**: In the final stage, we analyze the results of our modeling efforts and interpret the findings. Additionally, we outline potential avenues for further improvements to enhance predictive accuracy and efficiency.
