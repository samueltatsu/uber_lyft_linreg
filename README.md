# Uber & Lyft Price Prediction - Linear Regression Model

*Introduction*

Ride-hailing services have transformed urban transportation, offering users convenient and flexible mobility options. However, pricing transparency remains a key concern for both riders and service providers. In response to this challenge, this project focuses on developing an accurate and efficient pricing model for ride-hailing services.

*Objective*

This project aims to make a pricing model for ride-hailing services. We're using a method called linear regression to predict how much a ride will cost. We're looking at things like how far the ride is, what kind of service it is, and other important factors to make our predictions accurate and efficient.

*Dataset*

[Uber & Lyft Activities in Boston, MA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma) is very beginner-friendly dataset that is suitable to use for Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predictors.

*Method*

1. **Data Loading**: We start by retrieving the necessary data from our chosen source.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: During this phase, we explore the dataset to understand its characteristics and uncover insights. Through visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analyses, we gain valuable insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: This stage involves data preprocessing to create meaningful features for modeling. Techniques such as scaling of numerical features and encoding of categorical variables are employed here.

4. **Modeling**: We employ Linear Regression algorithm to develop a predictive pricing model for ride-hailing services. Model performance is then evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and MAPE to ensure robustness and generalizability.

5. **Conclusion**: In the final stage, we analyze the results of our modeling efforts and interpret the findings. Additionally, we outline potential avenues for further improvements to enhance predictive accuracy and efficiency.
